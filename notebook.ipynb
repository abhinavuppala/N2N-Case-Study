    "# Overview\n",
    "Online retailers face significant financial challenges due to high return rates, especially in industries like clothing, where return rates can be as high as 50%. While free or low-cost return shipping has become an expectation among customers, it places a substantial burden on businesses. To mitigate this, companies can leverage data-driven strategies to predict and reduce return rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to analyze the provided datasets and develop a predictive model that determines whether an ordered item will be returned. You will also extract actionable insights into the key factors influencing product returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dataset Description\n",
    "You will be provided with two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "N2N Train Set: Contains historical order data, including product details, user demographics, and whether the product was returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "N2N Test Set: A separate dataset for evaluation, where you will apply your model to predict return probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets contain the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "order_item_id: Unique identifier for each order.\n",
    "order_date: Date the order was placed.\n",
    "delivery_date: Date the product was delivered.\n",
    "item_id: Unique identifier for the product.\n",
    "item_size: Size of the ordered product.\n",
    "item_color: Color of the ordered product.\n",
    "brand_id: Unique identifier for the product's brand.\n",
    "item_price: Price of the product.\n",
    "user_id: Unique identifier for the customer.\n",
    "user_title: Customer's salutation or title.\n",
    "user_dob: Customer's date of birth.\n",
    "user_state: Customer's state of residence.\n",
    "user_reg_date: Date of customer registration on the platform.\n",
    "return: Binary indicator of return status (0 = not returned, 1 = returned).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These fields provide comprehensive details on customer orders, product characteristics, and user demographics, enabling the identification of patterns associated with product returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify trends and patterns in product returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examine relationships between product attributes, user demographics, and return behavior."
